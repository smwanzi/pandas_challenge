    "# PyCitySchools Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the data analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tPyCitySchools district performed above average with an overall passing rate of 80.39% with students doing better in reading (81.88%) compared to math’s (78.99). This suggest more attention should be put towards improving performance in math.\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tThe top 5 schools were Charter Schools, with a passing rate of 95.20% - 95.59% and the bottom 5 schools were District Schools, with a passing rate of 73.29% - 73.80%, this shows a significant difference in performance between Charter and District schools. One explanation for this could be that the district schools had on average many students.\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tSmall (94.82%) and Medium (95.20%) sized schools performed better than the Large (76.36%) sized schools, suggesting a correlation between the size of the school and performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "•\tschools that spent <585 dollars per student had a passing rate of 95.04%, whereas those that spent >645 dollars had and overall passing rate of 73.65.  This suggests the spending more per student does not significantly lead to better performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, I would recommend to the district to have more charter schools, reduce the number of students in district schools and maintain a budget of 615 dollars per student.\n",
